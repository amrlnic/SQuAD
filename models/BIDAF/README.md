# BIDAF model

* run the bidaf_preprocessing notebook
* run the bidaf_model notebook

you can now make predictions by using the script `compute_answer.py`

> You only need to run both notebooks for preprocessing / training / inference.
> The utils folder is where files (preprocessed datasets, tokenizers...) are saved.
> You can also find the same functions, classes as in the notebooks (they are imported in the `compute_answers.py` script)
