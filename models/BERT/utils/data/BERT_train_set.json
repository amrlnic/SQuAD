stage of the life course. this therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. so many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. all of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. a child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. an adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. while children that grow up in

years. during these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. in other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. but, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. the two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. the years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). the environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development. studies done by the american psychological association have shown that

home, adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends, and assumes a self-definition as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. in the final stage, known as commitment, the young adult adopts their

adolescent development. elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. the principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. the principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they

from \"outside\", and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. in rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. though most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. the cost of transport can reach as high as 50\u00a2 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. the cost of delivering a 1 us gallon (3.8 l) of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20\u201330\u00a2 higher than the continental united states average, with only hawaii having higher prices.", "qas":

softer than bronze. however, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. the ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 bc, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the middle ages. this method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. in 1740, benjamin huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 381, "text":

stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. in 1858, sir henry bessemer developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. the bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. once the bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow. mangalloy,

alsace experienced great prosperity during the 12th and 13th centuries under hohenstaufen emperors. frederick i set up alsace as a province (a procuratio, not a provincia) to be ruled by ministeriales, a non-noble class of civil servants. the idea was that such men would be more tractable and less likely to alienate the fief from the crown out of their own greed. the province had a single provincial court (landgericht) and a central administration with its seat at hagenau. frederick ii designated the bishop of strasbourg to administer alsace, but the authority of the bishop was challenged by count rudolf of habsburg, who received his rights from frederick ii's son conrad iv. strasbourg began to grow to become the most populous and commercially important town in the region. in 1262, after a long struggle with the ruling bishops, its citizens gained the status of free imperial city. a stop on the paris-vienna-orient trade route, as well as a port on the rhine route linking southern germany and switzerland to the netherlands, england and scandinavia, it became the political and economic center of the region. cities such as colmar and hagenau also began to grow in economic importance and gained a kind of autonomy within the \"decapole\" or \"dekapolis\", a federation of ten free towns.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 63, "text": "fragmentation and

that people left alsace, not only for paris \u2013 where the alsatian community grew in numbers, with famous members such as baron haussmann \u2013 but also for more distant places like russia and the austrian empire, to take advantage of the new opportunities offered there: austria had conquered lands in eastern europe from the ottoman empire and offered generous terms to colonists as a way of consolidating its hold on the new territories. many alsatians also began to sail to the united states, settling in many areas from 1820 to 1850. in 1843 and 1844, sailing ships bringing immigrant families from alsace arrived at the port of new york. some settled in illinois, many to farm or to seek success in commercial ventures: for example, the sailing ships sully (in may 1843) and iowa (in june 1844) brought families who set up homes in northern illinois and northern indiana. some alsatian immigrants were noted for their roles in 19th-century american economic development. others

temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs. migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. landbirds have a flight range of around 2,500 km (1,600 mi) and shorebirds can fly up to 4,000 km (2,500 mi), although the bar-tailed godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi). seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in new zealand and chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the north pacific off japan, alaska and california, an annual round trip of 64,000 km (39,800 mi). other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. albatrosses nesting in the southern ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between

was originally thought to control abscission. ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. it is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates
